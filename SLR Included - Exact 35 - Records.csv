The subject of the paper is intrapreneurship, which is a form of corporate entrepreneurship that refers to the individual behaviour of corporate employees. The main goal of the research was to analyse and evaluate the entrepreneurial potential of corporate employees and the working climate that affect significantly the development of intrapreneurship. The article is based on the author’s research, which was conducted by means of a survey among 320 employees and 60 executives at different levels taken on in 41 different types of corporations conducting business activity in Poland. By entering the research, it was assumed that the corporation was entrepreneurial if it employs entrepreneurial employees, and its working climate is conducive to undertaking entrepreneurial initiatives. The research showed the importance of the work climate for the development of intrapreneurship, which can be considered a dimension supporting the development of corporate entrepreneurship. It was also featured that not those employees who had intrapreneur potential were more involved in risky ventures, but those who felt that the company supported their actions. © 2021, Centre of Sociological Research.

The focus of this paper is to study the qualities of becoming a successful intrapreneur in India and the factors which encourage employees to become intrapreneurs and capitalize on new business ideas. The survey was conducted for 100 intrapreneurs in the growing organizations in Pune. These intrapreneurs were interviewed based on their contributions to the growth of the organization as suggested by the CEOs of the same company. The ordinal data was then transformed and used for analysis. For this, log transformation (monotonic function) was used. Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MVLRA) was the statistical tool used. The researchers found that majority of the entrepreneurs are willing to support employees who want to capitalize on a new business opportunity within their company and such employees are highly motivated in doing the challenging tasks in the companies. Start-ups, which are dedicated to excellence, innovation, team spirit and hunger for success, have qualities that create a unique and exciting culture that helps create more intrapreneurs, who in turn make start-ups and some of the most amazing companies in the world. An intrapreneur may not be open to sharing their ideas in environments that do not recognize those responsible for the ideas. The study highlighted that the hard core intrapreneurs showcase most important skills such as persuasion, creativity, and balancing.

This figure identifies the salaried worker with entrepreneurial behaviours within his or her company and can even create an ex novo one if the intra-enterprise programs of their company allow it. In the current discourses on business innovation, the intraentrepreneur emerges as a new archetype of the salaried worker, characterized by his or her involvement and the ability to innovate, and presents himself or herself as the ideal type in which any employee should project himself or herself. The intra-entrepreneur is an activation device for employees. The objectives of this article are to explore how the intrapreneur is built on the basis of business literature. To cover this objective, press releases, articles in monthly management magazines and academic journals in the area of economics and business will be analysed. A second objective seeks to place the figure of the intraentrepreneur in the context of changes in the organization of work during the post-Fordism. To this end, a critical analysis will be made of some of the main authors who have approached the issue from the point of view of economic sociology. © 2018 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.","2018","2024-04-17 13:59:36","2024-05-07 12:31:54","","285-303","","2","36","","Cuad.

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze the relationship between specific elements of the internal environment of a company with its intrapreneurship level. For this, we administered a questionnaire to 144 mid-level employees in the passenger transportation sector in Northeast Mexico, whose results were treated with multiple variable correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. The results of this study suggest a positive and significant impact of the administrative support and time availability on intrapreneurship, as well as a moderate effect of the rewards given to employees.

Not every corporate culture is a suitable environment for intrapreneurial behavior. This study examines the relationship between potential entrepreneurial behavior and preferred culture type. Through a principal component analysis of a sample of 1056 university students, four principal components of enterprising behavior (and roles) are found: Planning on results (project manager); Bearing the burden (pressure bearer); Innovating for others (innovating showstopper); and Learning from mistakes (experimental learner). Using the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument, a linear regression analysis was conducted of culture types against compo-nents. A combination of strong inverse and direct relationships are found between these components and culture types (clan, market, adhocracy, and hierarchy). The findings help practitioners under-stand how existing culture will inhibit or encourage enterprising behaviors, with potential benefits in recruitment and selection, reductions in staff turnover and increases in innovation potential. The findings also indicate a need for reconsideration of the employer brand when attracting intrapreneurs. © 2021 by the authors.

Using data collected from 425 working adults in the research/innovation and healthcare settings, we develop a self-report measure of employee intrapreneurial motivation. We also adapt an existing self-report measure of E, P, and L career motivations (previously developed and used with university students) for use with working adult organizational employees. Confirmatory factor analysis indicate that E, P, and L motivations and intrapreneurial motivation can be measured independently and reliably, while regression analyses show that the employees' E, P, and L motivations all contribute to explaining variance in their intrapreneurial motivation. Individuals with high E, P, and L motivational profiles are also found to have the highest intrapreneurial motivation scores, while those low on E, P, and L motivations have the least intrapreneurial motivation. Our findings suggest that the potential for intrapreneurship is not unique to only entrepreneurial employees. Instead, one can find intrapreneurs among employees with strong leadership and professional motivations as well. We discuss the findings in the context of generating more research to address the challenges of talent management in the 21st century knowledge economies where there is greater career mobility and boundarylessness in the workforce. © 2017 Chan, Ho, Kennedy, Uy, Kang, Chernyshenko and Yu.","2017","2024-03-18 17:50:33","2024-05-07 12:31:03","","","","NOV","8","","Front.

Design/methodology/approach: The challenge to the intrapreneurship concept is that no single or combination of personality traits, individual characteristics or attitudes can fulfill the causes of the phenomenon, as these factors are context-bound. One explanation for individual- and macro-level contrasting outcomes is the diverging effect of expectations. The structural and interactionist perspective of sociology is used to understand the intrapreneurship concept because intrapreneurs live within a society and shape their course per the expectations of others. Findings: Intrapreneurs have been trying to infer about what is seen as crucial individually related to interactions within the existing context; more importantly, acting in an intrapreneurship role can be defined and learned by expectations. Practical implications: With the convenient expectations from other members, families or environments, organization members will value the innovation and self-direction of intrapreneurship more highly that such a taste for an acting role may be an important factor in the decision to become an intrapreneur. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the paper emphasized for the first time that the consequences of exposure to social expectations for the development of intrapreneur roles, particularly the broad portfolios of skills and motivation, are relevant to intrapreneurship. Previous approaches depend on individuals, organizations or the environment to have different approaches to likely employees to be intrapreneurs. The paper first argues that context is important for understanding how and why context can be linked to individual intrapreneurs and how intrapreneurship can be defined as roles rather than a task or unique potential entrepreneurs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2021","2024-04-17 13:59:56","2024-05-07 12:30:35","","131-151","","1","13","","J.

Well-being is a multifaceted and extremely complex construct that is investigated in different fields. Nevertheless, it is a spontaneous manifestation, inherent to human beings, which is an expression of their true essence. The main purpose of this study is to check the emerging relationships between engagement, which is typical of the intrapreneur, and individual satisfaction/well-being. The research has explored the decisive factors in the manifestation of individual well-being among a sample of university students. This study can also contribute by exemplifying a University’s potential, in that it provides a global evaluation of these constructs with a specific focus on students. The student’s point of view, in fact, represents a strategic asset. It’s also crucial to underline the importance played by the awareness of students and of the University’s managers in regard to the analysed factors with the goal to enhance the role of the person. The aim of the research was to investigate the correlations and the relations between intrapreneurial self-capital, engagement, general well-being and satisfaction with life by using a sample of university students. The participants consist of 101 students and five tests have been administered. The results resulted in 8 upper-middle correlations. More specifically, it was found that well-being and satisfaction with life are strictly linked to engagement and also, as expected, that intrapreneur-self-capital higher-order construct play a key role in the manifestation of well-being. © 2018, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

Local initiatives describe how shop floor workers and middle managers initiate organizational change by developing ideas emerging in the daily operations. The purpose of this article is to elaborate on how and why such local initiatives emerge and develop. Design/methodology/approach - The paper combines theories about entrepreneurship and organizational change as a framework to understand local initiatives. Local initiatives contribute to the understanding of organizational change processes by emphasizing not only the voice of the managerial discourse but also the voice of local actors. The empirical findings are based on interviews in a paper pulp plant. Findings - Local initiatives are a way for shop floor workers and middle managers to translate work procedures into something that makes sense in their own context of daily operations. The intrapreneur acts not as a change agent for someone else's intentions but as a self appointed actor who initiates and drives the process of creating unequivocal interpretations of equivocal events. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on a single case study. Practical implications - The paper stresses the importance for managers to find ways to deal with local initiatives. Generating and collecting ideas is the easy part, the challenge is to do something with the ideas received.

Design/methodology/approach – The research proposes a model that starts with effective teambuilding within an intrapreneurial context, then encompasses the relationship between service and product as a platform for the development of more effective innovation. A two-part qualitative case study provides insight and understanding of the model's application within both service and manufacturing environments. Findings – Investigating service delivery shortfalls with effectively developed intrapreneurial teams leads to new and/or improved services. New service developments in turn lead to the development of new products. An action research model based on Deming's PDSA (plan, do, study, act) cycle determines the point of departure for each stage of innovation. The PDSA cycle provides a method for combining innovation, knowledge development and management. Practical implications – Current approaches focus on the characteristics of intrapreneurs rather than on the linked activities that lead to successful product/service innovation. Important issues such as how teams progress through the stages of service and product development are not usually considered. As a consequence, there is little in the extant literature to guide prospective intrapreneurs or organisations. Originality/value – Little research has been conducted into how intrapreneurship occurs in organisations. This paper provides insight into how intrapreneurship functions through new service and new product innovations in both the service and manufacturing sectors. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2007","2024-03-18 17:50:30","2024-05-07 12:37:22","","330-348","","6","13","","Int.

Individuals maximise their utility while deciding among three occupations: independent entrepreneurship, paid employment and intrapreneurship. I show that intrapreneurs resemble employees rather than entrepreneurs. Specifically, comparing the decision-making of intrapreneurs to that of entrepreneurs, the former are significantly more risk averse, expect lower but less uncertain reward and are broadly endowed with a poorer set of entrepreneurial abilities; despite having higher levels of human capital they fail to recognise business opportunities and have lower confidence in their entrepreneurial skills. A distinction within the category of intrapreneurship, based on the level of engagement and therefore the level of personal risks they bear, adds to our understanding of intrapreneurship. Engaged intrapreneurs, i.e., intrapreneurs that expect to acquire an ownership stake in the business, unlike the rest of intrapreneurs, share the attributes usually assumed to characterise entrepreneurs.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","2013-01","2024-04-17 20:30:40","2024-05-07 12:38:15","","27-39","","1","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1270351593","","85","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/aTMfU?_a=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&_s=%2BKdihaAhJviQSLiF6rwzoUAwic0%3D","Decision making; Intrapreneurship; Entrepreneurship; Engagement; GEM; Occupational choice theory; Entrepreneurs; Intrapreneurs; Employees; Business And Economics--Small Business; Self employment; Occupational choice; L26; Studies; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 9520:Small business; 6100:Human resource planning; Theory; Risk aversion; J24; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; COMPARATIVE studies; HUMAN capital; DECISION making; EMPLOYMENT; J31; J62; RISK aversion; VOCATIONAL guidance; Include-Screening-JournalArticles; Include-Screening-EBSCO","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, little research has addressed this important source of innovation. Using Innovation Value Chain theory, we theorize that individual, organizational, and innovation-specific factors influence intrapreneurial innovation, operationalized as managerial accountants' intentions to champion the adoption of an IT innovation within their organizations. Additionally, we consider how information system complexity may influence these factors. We test our model using a structural equation model (SEM) with 320 management accountants. Perceptions of organizational orientation toward innovation and of the technology are significant determinants of individuals' intention to champion the adoption of continuous monitoring. Individual inclination to innovate is not significant in the presence of the other two factors. We also find that system complexity lowers perceptions of the technology's benefits, thus inhibiting intention to champion.

Entrepreneurship in the organization has been defined in various ways over the years, which has led to terminological confusion. Due to the innovation required by organizations for a proactive adaptation to the change and sustainability, intrapreneurship acquires special relevance for business development. Therefore, a literature review that considers intrapreneurship and the issues related to this concept is much needed. The search term 'intrapreneur' resulted in 312 articles published in WoS (Web of Science) between 1985 and 2021. These articles were analyzed using the VOSviewer software for the bibliometric analysis. The main authors and contributions in the area have been identified, in relation to the research objectives, enabling the generation of guidelines and proposals for future research.

Design/methodology/approach: A meta-model was used to demonstrate how the two concepts overlap and what differences exist. Furthermore, a case study was conducted with an IT service provider from the banking sector in which 12 qualitative interviews with intrapreneurs were held and used to summarize the differences between projects and intrapreneurship initiatives from the intrapreneurs' point of view. Findings: This study identified two major differences: First, unlike in projects, the client has no clear objective in intrapreneurship; rather, only the sponsors maintain a general goal. Second, intrapreneurship allows for circumventing constraints and thus for working with more freedom and the possibility of failure. Originality/value: This study used an explanatory model to summarize differences and clarify the concept of intrapreneurship.
